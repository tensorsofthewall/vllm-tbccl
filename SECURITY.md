# Security policy

## Supported versions

vllm-tbccl has had no final release; 0.2.0rc1 is a release candidate and 0.2.0 is the first planned release. Once releases exist, security fixes are made against the latest release series only. Development versions and unreleased branches are not supported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability.

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting: open the repository's Security tab and choose "Report a vulnerability". If that option is not available, open an issue that says only that you have a security report and asks for a private channel; do not put details in it.

## What to include

- The affected version or commit and the platform.
- What you observed and what you expected.
- The smallest reproduction you can give: code, input bytes or steps.
- Whether you believe it is exploitable, and under which deployment assumptions.
- Whether and how you want to be credited.

Please do not include credentials, private keys or details of a private network.

## What to expect

This is a volunteer-maintained project. Reports are acknowledged on a best-effort basis, normally within a few days. A confirmed issue is fixed on the main branch first and released in the next release of the supported series; the advisory credits the reporter unless they ask otherwise. Please allow a reasonable time to fix a confirmed issue before you disclose it publicly.

## Scope

This policy covers the vLLM platform plugin and the patch files under vllm_tbccl/patches/. Bugs in the plugin code and in the patch files under vllm_tbccl/patches/ are in scope. Behavior of vLLM, vllm-metal or TBCCL themselves should be reported to those projects.

The supported deployment assumptions are described in the security model in the documentation: TBCCL assumes trusted peers on a trusted network.
