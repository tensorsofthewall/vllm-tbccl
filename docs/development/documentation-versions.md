# Documentation versions

The hosted documentation is built by Read the Docs from the configuration in `.readthedocs.yaml`, with the pinned requirements in `docs/requirements.txt`, and warnings fail the build.

| Version | Built from | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `latest` | the `main` branch | Development documentation. It is not a release, carries a banner that says so, and may describe behavior that no release contains yet. |
| `stable` | the newest release tag | The documentation of the latest release. It does not exist until the first release is tagged; nothing unreleased is ever published as `stable`. |
| a version such as `0.2.0` | a release tag `v0.2.0` | The documentation of that release. It is published only after the tag exists; 0.2.0 is a planned release and has not been tagged. |

Links from other projects to the TBCCL documentation use the core `stable` site; see {doc}`../related-projects`.

## Building and checking locally

`make docs` builds the documentation, `make docs-linkcheck` checks the local links, and the compatibility manifest check runs in the same CI job. None of them needs the network after the requirements are installed.

Cross-project references (Intersphinx) are off by default so that a build never depends on another site. Set `DOCS_INTERSPHINX=1` to enable them once the other projects publish their inventories; set `DOCS_INVENTORY_<PROJECT>` to a local `objects.inv` to use a local copy.
